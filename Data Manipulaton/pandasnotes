STEPS FOR DATA CLEANING AND PREPROCESSING :

1. FINDING NULL VALUES
2. HANDLING NULL VALUES
2. FIX CATEGORIAL INCONSISTENCIES LIKE making everyone in lowercase
3. REMOVE DUPLICATES
4. RENAME COLUMNS FOR BETTER readability
5. CREATE NEW necessary features
6. HOT OR LABEL CODE categrial DATA
7. CHANGE COLUMN dtypes if needed
8. CHECK OUTLIERS USING different methods


FEATURE ENGINEERING I LEARNT TODAY :
1. EXTRACTING FEATURES FROM DATE
2. BINING OR BUCKETING i.e. naming the age groups or any type of buckets (groups)
3. FEATURE INTERACTION : combining two features and making one
4. ONE HOT CODING : setting numerical values for categorial DATA
5. SCALING / NORMALISATION : bringing all the features on same scale , when they vary too much like age is small number but height in cm is a large number then normalization brings these features on sam escale
6. HANDLING SKEWED DATA : 
7. POLYNOMIAL FEATURES : squaring or raising the features to a power used when we need to square or cube or ... featrue matrix
8. MAPPING OR LABEL ENCODING : labeling the numbers and converting numerical data into categorial data like splitting into senior and junior on the basis of experience years
9. COUNT ENCODING : encoding on the basis of frequency
